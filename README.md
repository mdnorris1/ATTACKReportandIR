# ATT&CKReportandIR

Scenario 
I’m a cybersecurity analyst at a large SOC. We are a small 100–200 person company with an on-prem active directory infrastructure. (We are 100% on-prem, no 
cloud infrastructure in our environment.) All employees are assigned a Windows 10 Laptop 
which is domain joined by our IT department. We also have a plethora of Linux Servers hosting 
our web infrastructure.

Let’s talk about security products. Endpoint monitoring is in a rough state at the moment. We 
are currently checking out several vendors for the best price and security coverage. The 
Security engineers on the team are not remarkably familiar with Endpoint Policy configurations. 
They will need training for file integrity and process monitoring, so we need a user-friendly EDR 
(Endpoint Detection and Response) product with extensive training to get secure as fast as 
possible. We also understand that most Endpoint products allow the creation of custom-made 
detections. This is something we do not currently have and would love to build our own library 
of detections eventually. As for Network security, we are very well versed as we need to ensure 
that our web traffic is secure. We have several security controls for network protection such as 
web proxies, web content filters, and NextGen Firewalls which have excellent policy 
configurations that already have shown to detect and prevent malicious traffic with a low false 
positive rate. We currently utilize Splunk as our log aggregation and correlation engine for 
network events, and we plan to implement EDR products once we have decided which ones to 
go with. 
Our IT team is new with not a whole lot of security experience. They are familiar with Windows 
infrastructure but may need your help with access control settings so we can ensure that users 
have least privileged access. 
We are happy to have you! Now please, secure our company!

Goals & Objectives
Analyse the situation using the ATT&CK Calculator tool (https://top-attack-techniques.mitre-engenuity.org/calculator) and create a report to start building a response, building trust and improving security practices within the company.
